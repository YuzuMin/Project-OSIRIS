# Project OSIRIS
 A New Beginning with a series of small microcontroller projects

# ESP32 RISC GPU
The ESP32 GPU receives data via UART and outputs VGA over IÂ²S.

### Installation

This library only supports the ESP32.
To install the ESP32 features in the board manager you need to add an additional Boards Manager URL in the Preferences (File -> Preferences)
```
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```
The ESP32Lib can be found in the Library Manager (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libaries)
To be able to use the library featues the main header needs to included in the sketch
```cpp
#include <ESP32Lib.h>
```
